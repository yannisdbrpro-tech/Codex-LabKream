# KREAM Theme — SEO Notes

## Meta structure
- Title format: `{{ page_title }} — KREAM` or `KREAM — Street-luxe reinvented` on home.
- Meta description: concise authority statement, no keyword stuffing.

## Headings
- Each template uses a single H1 (hero title on home, collection title on collection pages, product title on PDP).
- Supporting sections use H2 for clarity and hierarchy.

## Images
- Provide alt text describing garment, edition, and color (e.g., “Crown Legacy Dad Hat in obsidian black”).
- Use optimized sizes; featured grids request 600px, gallery uses 900px.

## Internal links
- Primary nav links: Shop, Manifesto, Collections.
- Hero CTAs link directly to high-intent collections.

## Performance
- Preload `base.css` and defer `theme.js`.
- Minimal scripts, no external frameworks.

## Accessibility
- Skip link in layout.
- Focus states defined for CTAs and product cards.
- Accordions use native `<details>` for keyboard support.
